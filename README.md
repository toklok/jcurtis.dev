## Why?

I need a personal website to show that I am an actual person and not some mythilogical computer nerd.

## ðŸ§ž How to build?

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                       |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `pnpm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `pnpm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `pnpm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## Who am I?

I am an tech enthusiast, and a Father.
